Open Development Public License v1.0

0. Preamble

  The objective of the Open Development Public License v1.0 (ODPL) is to
  encourage the open source development of Software-as-a-Service code while
  also allowing the development of commercial offerings based around such open
  source code and without limiting the essential freedoms of the users or
  developers of code used in such commercial offerings.

  The ODPL is inspired by and derived from the Mozilla Public License v2.0.
  The ODPL differs from the MPL in a few ways. One that contributors to ODPL
  licensed projects should be particularly aware of is the default application
  of the ODPL to all code within a project or repository. A more granular
  application of licensing to individual source files is permitted, as long as
  the freedoms and rights granted by the ODPL are preserved.

2. License Grants and Conditions

2.1 Grants

  Each contributor hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
  license:

  a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
  Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify,
  display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions,
  either on an unmodified basis with Modifications, or as part of a Larger
  Work; and

  b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
  sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or
  its Contributor Version.

2.2 Effective Date

  The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
  effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
  distributes or otherwise makes available such Contribution as described in
  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5.

 2.3 Limitations on Grant Scope

  The licenses granted in this License are the only rights granted under this
  License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
  distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.

  Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
  Contributor:

    a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

    b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your or any other third party’s
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

    c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
    Contributions.

  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
  logos of any Contributor, except as may be necessary to comply with notice
  requirements in Section 3.6.

2.4 Subsequent Licenses

  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
  distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License
  (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
  under the terms of Section 3.5).

2.5 Representation

  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions
  are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights
  to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6 Fair Use

  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
  copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7 Conditions on License

  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 are conditions of the licenses
  granted in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities

3.1 Distribution of Covered Software

  All distribution of the Covered Software, including any Modifications that
  You create or contribute to, must be under the terms of this License. You
  must inform recipients or users of the Covered Software that it is is
  governed by the terms of this License and how they can obtain a copy of this
  License.

  You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ or users’ rights
  that they are granted by this License.

3.2 Distribution of Source Code Form

  Any distribution of Covered Software must include information on how a
  recipient or user can acquire the Source Code Form of the Covered Software
  via publicly accessible download.

3.3 Distribution of Executable Form

  If the Covered Software is distributed in Executable Form then:

    a. such Covered Software must be made available in Source Code Form as
    described in Section 3.2 and you must inform recipients and users of the
    Executable Form that the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
    License and how they can obtain a copy of this License. (See Exhibit B)

    b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license
    for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’
    or users’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.4 Distribution via Network Access

  You may use or distribute the Covered Software via Network Access, such as
  part of a Software-as-a-Service product or an API meant to be utilized by
  another application. If You distribute the Covered Software via Network
  Access, such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
  Form, as Described in Section 3.2. You must inform recipients and users of
  the Covered Software via Network Access that the Covered Software is
  governed by the terms of this License. (See Exhibit B)

3.5 Distribution of a Larger Work

  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
  Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
  with a work governed by one or more Secondary License(s), and the Covered
  Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits
  You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such
  Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their
  option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either
  this License or such Secondary License(s).

3.6 Notices

  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
  copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
  of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software,
  except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to
  remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.7 Application of Additional Terms

  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
  Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
  of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
  warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
  alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability
  incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
  liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of
  warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statue or Regulation

  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
  with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
  order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this
  License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and
  the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file
  included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License.
  Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
  must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able
  to understand it.

5. Termination

  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if
  You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
  then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are
  reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly
  and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such
  Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable
  means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover,
  Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis
  if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable
  means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance
  with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to
  30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,
  and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly
  infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all
  Contributors for the Covered Software under this License shall terminate.

  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end
  user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have
  been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior
  to termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

  Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
  warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
  without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
  merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
  risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
  Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
  correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of
  this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this
  License except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
  negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
  distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
  direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
  character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
  other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
  informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
  shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
  such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
  limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
  not apply to You.

8. Litigation

  Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
  of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
  business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction,
  without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section
  shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

  This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
  enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
  contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to
  construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of this License

10.1 New Versions

  Apogee Zenith, Inc. is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
  10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
  publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
  distinguishing version number.

10.2 Effect of New Versions

  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
  the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
  under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.

10.3 Modified Versions

  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create
  a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version
  of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the
  name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license
  differs from this License).

10.4 Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible with Secondary
Licenses

  If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
  Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
  notice described in Exhibit C of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

  This License is intended to affect, by default, the entire Repository of the
  Covered Software. However, this may not be desirable or possible. The
  following options are available:

    a. The default process to apply this License is to include the whole,
    unmodified text of this License in a “LICENSE” file, in the root directory
    containing the Repository. In such a process, the License would apply to
    all Covered Software in Source Code Form in the root directory and any
    subdirectories, in a recursive manner.

    This will permit You to easily use this License throughout Your entire
    Repository, or for a library contained within a single subdirectory of
    Your Repository.

    b. Should the need for a more granular application of the License notice
    be required, include the whole, unmodified text of this License in a file
    named “ODPLv1” and reference it within each file of the Covered Software
    as follows:

      “This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Open Development
      Public License, v1.0. The full text of the ODPL should be included with
      this file, in a file named “ODPLv1”. If it was not, you can obtain a
      copy at https://github.com/apogeezenith/odpl/blob/master/ODPLv1”

      This will permit You to include individual files from Covered Software
      within other repositories or software projects, even if that other
      repository or software project is licensed under different terms. If You
      do choose to include parts of the Covered Software within other software
      projects, You are still obligated to the terms of this License for the
      Covered Software within Your other software project.

Exhibit B - Executable and Network Access License Notice

  In the event that You distribute the Covered Software in Executable Form or
  via Network Access, You must provide notice to Your recipients and users
  that the Covered Software is governed by this License.

  This notice should be placed in an appropriate location where a recipient or
  user would likely look for such a notice. (For example, in the
  documentation.) The notice must include instructions that the recipient or
  user can use to download the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, as
  required in Section 3.2. The following example, included on the “About”
  section of an Executable Form or Software-as-a-Service application, would
  suffice:

    “All or part of this application’s source code is Licensed under the Open
    Development Public License v1.0 and the relevant code is available at
    http://www.github.com/apogeezenith/exampleapp”

Exhibit C - “Incompatible with Secondary Licenses” Notice

  Any file of Your Covered Software Source Code Form that contains
  Contributions that are not compatible with Secondary License(s) must
  prominently display the following notice within the file.

    “This Source Code Form is “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses”, as
    defined by the Open Development Public License, v1.0”
